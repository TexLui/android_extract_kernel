For a tutorial on aes key extraction, head over [here](https://bkerler.github.io/reversing/2019/04/24/the-game-begins/).

For extraction of libpatchapply.so or /sbin/recovery, use:

```
./ofp_libextract.py [your_ofp_file]
```

If you're getting a recovery.cpio.7z file, extract using 7z to get the /sbin/recovery file.
